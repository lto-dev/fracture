            Thank you for your contribution! Before we can merge this PR, you need to sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
            
            ## Why we need a CLA
            
            ApiQuest uses dual licensing (AGPL-3.0-or-later OR Commercial). **This enables dual licensing and keeps the project sustainable.** The CLA allows HumanHub LLC to offer commercial licenses while ensuring the open-source version remains freely available.
            
            ## What you're agreeing to
            
            - You grant HumanHub LLC the right to use your contribution under both AGPL-3.0-or-later and commercial licenses
            - **You retain your copyright** - you still own your code
            - Your contribution remains open source under AGPL-3.0-or-later
            
            [Read the full CLA](https://github.com/hh-apiquest/fracture/blob/main/CLA.md)
            
            ## How to sign
            
            1. Read the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/hh-apiquest/fracture/blob/main/CLA.md)
            2. Comment on this PR: **"I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA"**
            3. You only need to sign once - it applies to all your future contributions
